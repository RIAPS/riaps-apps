# RIAPS Applications Developed by North Carolina State University

This is a collection of applications used for microgrid control. The seven major applications are:

1. ac-microgrid-resync: This application is for microgrid resynchronization. It uses the RIAPS platform as a simple communication tool for receving and forwarding C37.118 messages from SEL relay and to Opal-RT simulator. No control algortihm is implemented on the RIAPS platform. All the control algorithms, including power electronics inverter control and microgrid secondary/resynchronziation control, are implemented in Opal-RT simulator. This application was demonstrated at the 2017 ARPA-E Energy Innovation Summit.  

2. ac-microgrid-resync-availability: This application is similar to microgrid-resync. It is augumented with an availability check function to select the available DG to act as microgrid resynchronization DG. More details about the availability check can be found in [1].

3. **ac-microgrid-resync-dsp**: This application is for microgrid synchronization. Compared to microgrid-resync, several major changes have been made:
      - The inverter control algorithms, including inner current loop, outer voltage loop, and droop loop are implemented in the DSP TMS320F28377S from Texas Instruments.
      - A distributed microgrid secondary/resynchronziation control algorithm is used [2].
      - The secondary/resynchronziation control algorithm is implemented on RIAPS platform.

   This application was demonstrated at the 2018 ARPA-E Energy Innovation Summit.

4. **ac-microgrid-resync-dsp-RelayInOpal**: This applicaion is the same as **ac-microgrid-resync-dsp** except the relay is simulated in Opal-RT simulator. The demonstration can run without a SEL relay.

5. **ac-microgrid-transactive-energy-in-grid-tied**: This application is for microgrid transactive energy trading under grid-tied mode. For detail about the transactive part can be found in [3].


6. **dc-microgrid-interleaving**: This application is for interleaving the DC/DC converters in a DC microgrid. More details can be found in [4].

7. **MQTTModbus**:  This application enables a user interface communication through a MQTT communication channel to remote RIAPS nodes.

The up-to-date applications are marked as **bold**.
